                <p>Hello! My name is Wyse, Utieyin Trevor and I am from Delta State, Nigeria. 
                I love swimming, football and solviing mathematics. I am a Subsea Inspection
                Engineer but decided to study Software development because I believe it is the 
                now and future. The Covid-19 pandemic helped reemphasize to me the counsel of our 
                former President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Prophet, 
                Gordon B Hinckely on the need to acquire valuable education and skills because 
                while many people lost their jobs because of the Lock down, those with ensseial 
                skills such as tech skills, continued working mostly from home to provide for 
                their loved ones.
